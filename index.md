_**[S&P500 10-k Sentiment Analysis](Report.md)**_

The objective of this project was to examine the relationship between the tone and sentiment expressed in S&P500 companies' 10-k filings and their subsequent stock returns. To achieve this, I used the provided stock return data and devised measures to determine stock performance following the release of these 10-k filings.
